- [x] dplyr
- [x] ggplot2
- [x] ggpubr

## 💡 Analysis
- A 1-year increase in age causes the log odds of having diabetes to increase by 0.056 units, holding the other independent variables (BMI, gender), constant.

- The number of observations is 403 with 28 variables. The percentages of individuals who are obese is 38.3%, who are female is 58.1%, or have diabetes is 15.4%. The average age is 47 and the average BMI is 28.8 units.

- Figures 1 and 2 display simply the frequency of each labeled category of the insurance and smoking vars. As shown, govt insurance group is the highest while none is the lowest, and never smoking is the highest while currently ex-smoker beats the lowest. As shown in figure 3, most of the points lay between a BMI 20-35 with cholesterol levels between 150 to 250 units. The regression line increases linearly as well with a R value of .09 and p = .088. Figure 4 shows the frequency of age distribution as it can be concluded that the average age is around 47.
